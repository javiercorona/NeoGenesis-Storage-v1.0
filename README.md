🚀 Introducing NeoGenesis Storage v1.0
🔐 Post-Quantum | 🧬 DNA-Encoded | 🧠 BioSecure | 🌐 Blockchain-Attested

I’ve just completed development on a fully simulated molecular storage system designed for next-gen digital sovereignty and AI safety. NeoGenesis Storage blends:

🔸 Quantum Fountain & LDPC Codes
🔸 Synthetic DNA Encoding (A/C/G/T/X/Y/Z)
🔸 Secure SGX Enclave Execution
🔸 Blockchain-Verified DNA Ledger
🔸 Epigenetic Metadata (CRISPR Map)
🔸 Quantum Entanglement Signature Verification
🔸 Nanopore + Plasmonic Read Simulation

📦 Output: Tamper-proof, self-verifying MolecularTicket for ultra-secure data storage.

🧬 Designed for the Quantum Sovereign AI Nation framework — securing not just bits, but bio-integrity, identity, and truth itself.
